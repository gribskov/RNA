# RNA XIOS Fingerprint

## Installation
1. Create a directory for the package
```
mkdir rna
cd rna
```
2. Install the XIOS/fingerprint package by cloning the git trepository. 
This will create a directory ***RNA*** with the XIOS/fingerprint code
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/RNA.git
```
2. Install Matthews RNAstructure package (command line version).
See https://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructureDownload.html for more information. 
This will create a directory called ***RNAstructure***. Most of the scripts assume 
that the ***RNAstructure*** directory is a sub-directory of the parent directory of 
***RNA***, *i.e.* ***../RNAstructure***.
```
wget https://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/Releases/current/RNAstructureLinuxTextInterfaces64bit.tgz
tar -xvzf RNAstructureLinuxTextInterfaces64bit.tgz
```

## Making the motif library
Available soon

## Constructing fingerprints from sequence
* Sequences should be in FASTA format and should contain only RNA bases ACGU
* Code locations below are with respect to the ***RNA*** directory.

Multiple steps can be run using *manager_new.py* (see *Job Manager*, below), which manages 
submitting multiple jobs 
in a workflow as individual *SLURM* jobs. See *parameter_sweep.py* for an example of how 
to run *manager_new.py* on a series of three computational steps. 


### Calculate XIOS graphs from structural ensemble
#### ../RNAstructure/partition
Calculate the partition function from the FASTA file. 
The partition function is used to sample in structures according to their free energy of folding
(Î”G) in the next step.
 * input: FASTA sequence - *.fa
 * output: partition function - *.pfs
 * options
   - -t \<int> folding temperature (K), e.g. 260 - 340K

#### ../RNAstructure/stochastic
Probabalistically sample structures from the partition function according to free energy of folding.
Sampling uses a random number generator which must be seeded; the same seed will always generate the
same samples. For testing, you may want to use the same seed to guarantee that results are comparable.
The seed should be a large integer without obvious small factors - the current system 
time is often used.
 * input: *.pfs
 * output: *.ct
 * options
   - -s \<int> random number seed for sampling (default=1234 which is not a good seed)

#### stochastic_to_xios.py ####
Calculate XIOS graph from sampled ct files 
 * input: *.ct
 * output: *.xios
 * options
   - -c \<int> minimum number of counts to include paired bases as a stem (default=50)
   - -m \<int> minimum number of paired bases in a stem (default=3)

## Job manager ##
A large scale analysis, or even one with only a few hundred sequences, requires executing workflows 
of multiple programs from the RNAstructure and XIOS RNA packages. If executed as individual jobs on 
a compute cluster, thousands of jobs may need to be launched and tracked. On computers with large 
multi-processor compute nodes, the clusters we use typically use have 128-256 cpus, it is more 
efficient to run a single job that internally manages the usage of the cpus. We provide a flexible job 
manager in *new_manager/manager.py* for running arbitrary pipelines in a ***SLURM*** controlled 
cluster environment

Features
1. Can run pipelines with any number of steps using a ***YAML*** formatted file to define the workflow
2. Allows symbols to be used to define workflow steps.
3. All workflow steps are logged with timestamps.
3. When processes are terminated due to expiration of the time limit, the workflow can automatically
restart from the last successful step.
